# Google-Play-Store-Ratings-Dataset-Python-
ObjecƟve:
The objecƟve of this project was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
and data preprocessing on a dataset containing informaƟon about mobile apps 
from the Google Play Store. The goal was to prepare the data for future 
predicƟve analyƟcs studies, helping app developers make informed decisions 
to enhance the success of their applicaƟons. 
What I Did: 
I began by imporƟng the necessary libraries and reading the dataset. AŌer 
gaining an iniƟal understanding of the data, I checked for duplicate records and 
invalid categories in the 'Category' column, ensuring data cleanliness. I 
addressed missing values in the 'RaƟng' column and created a new 'RaƟng 
category' feature for further analysis. To handle outliers in the 'Reviews' 
column, I applied a log transformaƟon. AddiƟonally, I converted non-numeric 
values in the 'Size' column and treated the 'Installs' and 'Price' columns to make 
them suitable for analysis. Redundant columns were dropped, and categorical 
columns were encoded. Finally, I segregated the target and independent 
features, split the dataset into training and tesƟng sets, and standardized the 
data for consistency. 
Project Overview: 
This project was part of my coursework at Great Learning Career Academy, 
with guidance from my mentor, Ranjith Gomez. It involved the analysis and 
preprocessing of a Google Play Store dataset to prepare it for predicƟve 
analyƟcs. By cleaning and transforming the data, I aimed to assist app 
developers in making informed decisions about their applicaƟons' potenƟal for 
success. This project showcased my proficiency in data manipulaƟon, 
exploratory data analysis, and data preprocessing techniques, which are 
essenƟal skills for data-driven decision-making in various domains, including 
the mobile app industry.
